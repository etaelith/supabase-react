# Supabase React TypeScript Project

This is a project leveraging Supabase, React, and TypeScript.

## Overview

The application is built using several prominent technologies and frameworks, including:

- **Supabase:** An open-source Firebase alternative, used as the backend for this application.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript:** A strongly typed superset of JavaScript, providing static types to the application.
- **Vite:** A modern front-end build tool, used for bundling the application.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`, `pnpm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the project with `npm run dev`, `pnpm dev` or `yarn dev`.

## Database Tables

This project uses the following database tables:

# bill:

table stores information about bills or invoices. Here is a description of the table columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each bill. It is an auto-incrementing integer.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the bill was created. It has a default value of the current timestamp.
- `name`: The name or description of the bill. It is a non-null text field.
- `paid_up`: A boolean field indicating whether the bill has been paid or not. It has a default value of `false`.
- `user_id`: The UUID of the user associated with the bill. It is a non-null field.
- `amount`: The numeric value representing the amount of the bill. It is a non-null field.

```sql
create table
  public.bill (
    id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    name text not null,
    paid_up boolean not null default false,
    user_id uuid not null,
    amount numeric not null,
    constraint Bill_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;

create trigger trigger_update_user_summary_bill
after insert
or delete
or
update on bill for each row
execute function update_user_summary ();
```

| id     | created_at                   | name        | paid_up   | user_id                              | amount    |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| `int8` | `now()`                      | `text`      | `boolean` | `uuid()`                             | `numeric` |
| 125    | 2023-05-17 21:07:30.96618+00 | electricity | false     | 9311e255-4a5b-4222-b0b4-36547a2b0bf9 | 2500.75   |

The table also has a primary key constraint on the `id` column.

Additionally, there is a trigger named `trigger_update_user_money` associated with the `bill` table. The trigger is fired after any `insert`, `delete`, or `update` operation on the `bill` table. It executes a function named `update_user_money()`.

# user_summary:

The `user_summary` table stores information about the money balance for each user. Here is a description of the table columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each record in the table. It is an auto-incrementing integer.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the record was created. It has a default value of the current timestamp.
- `total_paid`: The total amount of money associated with the user. It is a non-null numeric field with a default value of 0.
- `total_unpaid`: The amount of money paid out by the user. It is a non-null numeric field with a default value of 0.
- `total_user_amount`: The amount of money the user have. It is a non-null numeric field with a default value of 0.
- `user_id`: The UUID of the user associated with the money balance. It is a non-null field.

The table also has a primary key constraint on the `id` column and a unique constraint on the `user_id` column.

```sql
create table
  public.user_summary (
    id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    user_id uuid not null,
    total_paid numeric not null default '0'::numeric,
    total_unpaid numeric not null default '0'::numeric,
    total_user_amount numeric not null default '0'::numeric,
    constraint user_summary_pkey primary key (id),
    constraint user_summary_user_id_key unique (user_id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

| id     | created_at                   | total_paid | total_unpaid | total_user_amount | user_id                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `int8` | `now()`                      | `numeric`  | `numeric`    | `numeric`         | `uuid()`                             |
| 2      | 2023-05-17 21:07:30.96618+00 | 25.50      | 0            | 50000             | 9311e255-4a5b-4222-b0b4-36547a2b0bf9 |

# user_amount:

The `user_summary` table stores information about the money balance for each user. Here is a description of the table columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each record in the table. It is an auto-incrementing integer.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the record was created. It has a default value of the current timestamp.
- `amount`: The total amount of money associated with the user. It is a non-null numeric field with a default value of 0.
- `description`: The name or description of the pay.
- `user_id`: The UUID of the user associated with the money balance. It is a non-null field.

```sql
create table
  public.user_amount (
    id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
    user_id uuid not null,
    amount numeric not null,
    description text null,
    constraint user_amount_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;

create trigger trigger_update_user_summary_user_amount
after insert
or delete
or
update on user_amount for each row
execute function update_user_summary ();
```

| id     | created_at                   | amount    | description | user_id                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `int8` | `now()`                      | `numeric` | `text`      | `uuid()`                             |
| 2      | 2023-05-17 21:07:30.96618+00 | 25.50     | 0           | 9311e255-4a5b-4222-b0b4-36547a2b0bf9 |
